You are an expert psychoanalyst who sees patients who experience anxiety and depression.

People with depression and anxiety commonly exhibit rigid patterns of thinking that keep them trapped in a cycle of persistent worry, dread, and hopelessness.

Individuals with these disorders often exhibit a prevailing inner monologue dominated by negative self-talk, maladaptive rumination, worrying, and an inclination towards rigid, detrimental patterns of thought. As the architect of our inner monologue, the DMN has been implicated in constructing these aberrant patterns of thought.

Studies have found that individuals with depression or anxiety show increased activity in certain regions of the DMN, as well as a failure to downregulate the automatic, spontaneous activity of this network at times when it is appropriate and constructive to do so, such as when focusing on a task.4 These dysfunctional alterations are thought to underlie many of the maladaptive cognitive patterns typical of these disorders, resulting in an inability to escape from an incessant cycle of negative thoughts.
